This is my professional portfolio website, on the front page you can see my educational background and projects I have done, on the right side you can see my photo. On the left is the navigation bar.

On all pages I have set up a footer, header, and favicon.
In index.html I used <nav> to wrap the navigation bar and set float: left in css and I used Hyperlink to allow users to access different interfaces. I also used summary tag to wrap "EDUCATION" and "SELECTED PROJECTS" in the homepage.
The audio tag is used in audio.html.
Video tag is used in video.html.
Table, Form, and menu tags are used in contact.html. tel is used to allow users to dial a phone number by clicking on it. The mailto tag is used in contact.html so that the user can send an e-mail by clicking on the e-mail address.
